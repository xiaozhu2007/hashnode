The first “forest library” in Shanghai recently opened to the public, giving readers the chance to relax and read in a natural environment.

Known as <mark>Read &amp; Joy Forest</mark>, the forest library was jointly launched by Pudong New Area and Shanghai Library and is located in an urban green space area near Shanghai Library East. Covering an area of <mark>20,546 square meters</mark>, it allows visitors to take a pleasant walk in the quiet and verdant forest, which includes <mark>Camphor</mark>, <mark>Cedar</mark> and <mark>Osmanthus</mark> trees.

The design of the forest library ensures minimal disturbance to the forest, with existing green spaces connected by wooden walkways. The library is in the open air and equipped with facilities such as benches and an information booth.

"I learned about the forest library from my friends, so I came here," said a 21-year-old college student surnamed Wang. "The green outdoor environment helps reduce eyestrain. I will come back for sure."

Having a library in the woods is an extension of reading indoors, according to Xu Qiang, deputy head of Shanghai Library. "It offers different reading experiences to readers," Xu added.

Most of the visitors to the forest library were young people and parents with their children, who either immersed themselves in reading or took strolls in the forest. "I was impressed by the fresh air and the scents of the trees here. I spent the whole morning indoors and wanted to get some fresh air. The library makes it possible to enjoy reading in natural surroundings. I feel very relaxed here," said one reader sitting on a bench.
